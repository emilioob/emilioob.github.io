- Knowing one's self (what energy level is at, what tasks is suited for that energy level, optimize)
- Finish tasks before it gets urgent -> optimizes time flexibility
- Flexibility often plays into efficiency [^1]
- Batching tasks w/ low concentration requirement. Exclusive focus on tasks w/ high concentration req.
- Invest serious amount of time to learning skills that will be repeatedly used 
- live and let live. Serendipity
