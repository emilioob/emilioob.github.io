    <h1 class="main">Hi there, I'm Emilio Bachtiar.</h1>
	<p>I'm a current PhD student (2018) in Mechanical Engineering at Duke University working on development and characterization of 3D printed medical implants. I did my MSE at Johns Hopkins doing pretty much the same thing prior to moving to Duke and did my BS in Indonesia at ITB. My past work has been fairly eclectic, including: trying my hands at entrepreneurship, working at one of the largest PE firms in Indonesia, and a stay in Japan doing research on carbon nanotube composites.  <p>

	<p>Here you'll find much of my admittedly scattered thoughts about my work in STEM, life, books, and entrepreneurship, put into writing.<p>
